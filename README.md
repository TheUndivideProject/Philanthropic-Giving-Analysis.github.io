# Philanthropic Giving Analysis in Environmental and Social Justice

This repository is dedicated to conducting a comprehensive analysis of existing philanthropic giving towards environmental and social justice initiatives. By leveraging databases, financial reports, and publicly available information, we aim to assess the level of transparency and accountability in current giving practices.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze accountability and transparency in philanthropic giving to environmental and social justice causes. We explore and clean the data collected by our nonprofit organization to uncover insights into the allocation and impact of funds in this sector.

### Objectives

- **Data Exploration:** Delve into the collected data to understand the landscape of philanthropic giving.
- **Data Cleaning:** Prepare the data for analysis by cleaning and structuring it appropriately.
- **Analysis:** Conduct in-depth analysis to assess transparency and accountability in philanthropy towards environmental and social justice.
- **Reporting:** Compile findings into comprehensive reports to share with stakeholders and the public.
